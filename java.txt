Some things may have changed since you left the language, here some personal proposals:
•Servlets and JSP, you should take the dust off to this and include some EL (Enterprise Language)
•A build tool (Maven or Ant), most of Java application are now built with the help of them.
•Any Web Framework (Spring MVC, Struts2 or JSF are good choices)
•IoC and ORM (Spring and Hibernate are good choices)
•Take a look to Apache Commons and use them when possible

Also some features from Java 5+ like:
•Annotations
•Generics
